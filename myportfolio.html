          About Me

        <p>
Hello and welcome to my portfolio page. This page has been created to showcase my work in front-end web development. I currently live in Rhode Island and obtained my BA in Psychology from the University of Hartford. While there I took the Myers-Briggs Personality Test and discovered that the ideal job for my personality type was computer programming. However, I was a little late in discovering this as I was just finishing up my Psychology degree. Years later I came across the self-taught methods of coding and decided that this was my chance to do something different. Upon going through Free Code Camp and Code Academy, I discovered that this really was something that I love to do. I enjoy the fact that I can create something while still learning the various languages and systems. I have come to enjoy doing this in my free time, and my goal is to make a career out of something that I love to do.
